      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The Ford Motor Company was founded by Henry Ford on June 16, 1903, in Dearborn, Michigan. It is one of the largest automakers in the world, known for revolutionizing the 
automotive industry with the introduction of assembly line production techniques, particularly with the Model T in 1908. Over the years, Ford has expanded its operations globally 
and introduced various innovations in automotive technology. The company has a rich history that includes significant milestones such as the establishment of the Lincoln
 Motor Company in 1919 and the introduction of the 40-hour workweek in 1914, which set a precedent for labor practices in the industry</p>
