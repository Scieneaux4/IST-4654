      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Toyota's history begins with Sakichi Toyoda, who invented the world's first automatic loom in 1924. His son, Kiichiro Toyoda, established the Automotive Division within Toyoda Automatic Loom Works in 1933, paving the way for Toyota's entry into car manufacturing. The company officially became Toyota Motor Corporation in 1937. </p>
