      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Ferrari is an iconic Italian luxury sports car manufacturer, founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 out of Alfa Romeo's race division, Auto Avio Costruzioni. However, the first car to bear the Ferrari name, the 125 S, was completed in 1947. Powered by a V12 engine designed by Gioachino Colombo, it marked the beginning of Ferrari's legacy in high-performance engineering.

Ferrari quickly established itself in motorsport, particularly in Formula One, where it became one of the most successful teams in history. The brand won its first Formula One World Championship in 1951 and has since become synonymous with racing excellence.

Over the decades, Ferrari has built a reputation not just for performance but also for style, with models like the 250 GTO and F40 and modern icons like the LaFerrari capturing the imagination of car lovers around the world.

Today, the Ferrari remains a symbol of speed, luxury, and Italian craftsmanship, and it has a strong presence in both motorsport and the global luxury car market.</p>
