      <h2>History</h2>
      <p> Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to
 compromise to drive electric. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy
 generation and storage products. Nikola Tesla, on the other hand, was a Serbian American inventor and engineer who 
discorverd and patented the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current machinery. 
He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission.</p>

            <td>The Tesla Model S is an all-electric luxury sedan and the first vehicle developed from the ground up by Tesla.
 It was originally unveiled as a prototype in 2009 and made its official debut in 2012. The Model S is very much an executive 
saloon, with similar long and low design lines as you might find on a Jaguar. Tesla has continued updating the Model S since 
its release, and there are currently two versions: Model S and Model S Plaid.</td>
            <td>The Tesla Model 3 is a battery electric compact executive car with a fastback body style. 
It was marketed as being more affordable to more people than previous models by Tesla.
 The Model 3 comes very well equipped, with notable features including the Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system,
 heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel and a panoramic glass roof. The Model 3 delivers 
an overall enjoyable driving experience, with plenty of range and ease-of-charging. </td>
            <td>The Tesla Model Y is a battery electric mid-size crossover SUV produced by Tesla, Inc. since 2020.
 It shares the same platform as the Model 3 sedan but offers a rear hatch and more interior space. Currently available
 in two dual motor, AWD versions – Long Range and Performance – the Model Y has a 75 kWh battery pack, can travel an
 EPA-estimated 326 miles on a single charge, and reaches a top speed of 135 mph.</td>
            <td>The Tesla Cybertruck is a battery electric pickup truck with a controversial body design made of flat
 stainless steel sheet panels. It promises an impressive range of over 500 miles on a single charge, boasts an adaptive air
 suspension system, and is available in single motor RWD, dual motor AWD, and tri-motor AWD configurations. 
The Cybertruck combines sports car acceleration and handling with heavy-duty truck towing capacity.</td>
